# roller_coaster_control_panel_v1
This is the first working version of my 8-button Arduino roller coaster control panel. Feel free to visit my website below and see more details.

This is very unpolished intitial code for the control panel, but it still works. You can view an image of the actual panel I built and the process I went through all on my website!
